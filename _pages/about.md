<br>

The Wexler group is focused on theoretical materials innovation for renewable 
energy and environmental applications, with a special emphasis on the 
development of computational methods for the more realistic modeling of 
interfacial phenomena in electrocatalysis, solar energy conversion, and 
environmental energy harvesting. I am driven by the prospects of using first 
principles calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning as a 
synergistic approach for developing a fundamental understanding of complex 
materials systems, discovering relationships between their structure and 
function, and identifying promising routes for device optimization.
