# Head-Marsden Group Research

Contemporary problems in materials science and chemistry require theoretical and computational methods that accurately and efficiently capture quantum behavior. Important phenomena including exciton transport and decoherence dynamics in quantum systems are frequently driven by interactions with an external environment. The field of open quantum systems provides a lens to consider such environmentally driven dynamical processes. Our research focuses on developing and applying methods in open quantum systems, quantum information, and electronic structure to provide a holistic perspective on molecular, material, and condensed matter systems. Key areas of research include:
{: .text-justify}

* Classical method development for the treatment of complex environmentally driven dynamics in open quantum systems

* Quantum algorithm development for chemical applications with an emphasis on time-evolving electronic structure

* Open quantum system methods applied to quantum hardware characterization

* Electronic structure characterization of correlated molecular and material systems
