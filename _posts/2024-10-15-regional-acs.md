Tim Krogmeier and Whitney Short attended the Midwest Regional ACS Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska this week! Tim gave an excellent talk on his recent
<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/sc/d4sc05627b">work</a> focused on using the Lindblad equation to predict spin-spin decoherence in molecular systems, while Whitney gave a poster on her upcoming work adapting the Redfield equation for quantum computation. 

They also had time to meet with collaborator <a href="https://www.creighton.edu/campus-directory/parsons-bradley-f">Prof. Brad Parsons</a> and get a tour of his lab at Creighton University!
