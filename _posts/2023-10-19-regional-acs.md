The [Wexler](https://wexlergroup.github.io/) and Head-Marsdeon groups co-hosted a special symposium at the Midwest-Great Lakes Regional ACS Meeting entitled <em> Chemical Theory Across Scales </em> with a great lineup of speakers:
[Micheline Soley](https://sites.google.com/site/michelinesoley/), [David Mazziotti](https://mazziotti.uchicago.edu/), [Bess Vlaisavljevich](https://usdchemistry.com/vlaisavljevich/), [Chris Bartel](https://bartel.cems.umn.edu/), and [Chris Wolverton](https://sites.google.com/site/wolvertonresearchgroup/).

We also had great group turn out with several excellent presentations including:
