[Our group's first paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpca.3c03827) 
is officially published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry virtual special issue “Physical Chemistry of Quantum Information Science”! In this paper we demonstrate why a certain Copper based molecule has the potential to be a good qubit, and we provide guidance for modeling these types of complexes in the future.
