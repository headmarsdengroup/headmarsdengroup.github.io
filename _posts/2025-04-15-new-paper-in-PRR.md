We have a [new paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.7.023057) out in Physical Review Research, led by graduate student Koray AydoÄŸan! In this work we find  optimal system-environment parameters to stabilize highly entangled states in dissipative quantum systems whose dynamics are governed by the Lindblad equation.
