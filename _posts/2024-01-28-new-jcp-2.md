We have a [new paper](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0188066) out in the Journal of Chemical Physics in collaboration with the [Mabbs Group](https://sites.wustl.edu/mabbsgroup/) at Washington University in St. Louis!
This study investigates the photoelectron spectra of NiO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, providing insight into the energies and characteristics of both 
the anionic and resulting neutral states. The research uncovers both direct and indirect pathways for electron detachment.
