[Our group's second paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/159/13/134305/2914200) 
is officially published in The Journal of Chemical Physics! In this work we use correlated excited state methods to describe vibrational and electronic transitions from REMPI spectra of isoquinoline in collaboration with experimentalists from Creighton University.
