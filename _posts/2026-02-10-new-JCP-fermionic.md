Graduate student Mikayla Fahrenbruch’s <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/164/6/064108/3379016/Preserving-fermionic-statistics-for-single">first first-author paper</a> was recently published in the Journal of Chemical Physics!  Here, we derived constraint requirements for microscopic master equations to preserve N-representable dynamics in one-body approximations.
