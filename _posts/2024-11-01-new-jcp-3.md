We have a [new paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/161/17/174103/3318456/Orbital-entanglement-and-the-double-d-shell-effect) out in the the Journal of Chemical Physics! Here we focus on investigating the effects of the second *d*-shell on a series of transition metal hydrides and oxides. This work was led by [Julie Lampert](https://chem.yale.edu/profile/julie-lampert) who was an undergraduate in the group for two years before starting as a graduate student at Yale University this fall.
