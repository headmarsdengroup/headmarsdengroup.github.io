We have a [new paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphyschemau.4c00018) out in ACS Physical Chemistry Au!
Led by undergraduate Emily Oh, we apply our recently developed [SVD-based algorithm](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.106.022414) to model the open dynamics in systems of biological relevance, including excitonic energy transport and a radical pair mechanism.
