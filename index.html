The Head-Marsden Group seeks to elucidate electronic structure properties and open quantum system dynamics relevant in emerging quantum materials 
and technologies. Our research emphasizes on classical method development, alongside algorithm development for use on noisy-intermediate scale 
quantum computers. With these methods and algorithms, we hope to make predictions for correlated molecular systems undergoing complex environmental 
interactions with applications in chemistry, physics, and materials science.
